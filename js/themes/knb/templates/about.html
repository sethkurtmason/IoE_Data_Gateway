          About the KNB
        </h2>
        <p class="lead">
          The Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB) is an international
          repository intended to facilitate ecological and environmental
          research.
        </p>
        <img class="pull-right" style="height: 150px;width: 150px; margin: 10px 40px 10px 20px" alt="Data underlies metadata" src="./js/themes/knb/img/data-metadata-graphic.png">
        <p>
          For scientists, the KNB is an efficient way to discover, access and
          interpret complex ecological data. Due to the rich contextual
          information, scientists are able to integrate and analyze data with
          less effort. The data originate from a highly-distributed set of
          field stations, laboratories, research sites, and individual
          researchers. The foundation of the KNB is the rich, detailed metadata
          provided by researchers that collect data, which promotes both
          automated and manual integration of data into new projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of the KNB effort, data management software is developed in a
          free and open source manner, so other groups can build upon the tools.
          The KNB is powered by the Metacat data management system, and is
          optimized for handling data sets described using the Ecological 
          Metadata Language, but can store any XML-based document.

          Using the KNB
        </h2>
          <p>
            As a long-term repository, the KNB allows you to preserve your data
            for future generations of scientists. However, you can and to share
            your data with your colleagues today, and get a permanent
            identifier for all files in your data set. The KNB supports <a
            href="http://www.doi.org/">Digital Object Identifiers</a> (DOIs),
            so your data sets can be confidently referenced in any publication.
            And as a <a href="http://dataone.org">DataONE</a> Member Node, the
            KNB will securely replicate you data to other servers, maintaining
            all of the access controls you set, public or private. This means
            that your data are secure in the event that the KNB servers
            themselves experience any catastrophic failure.

          Sharing your data
        </h3>
        <p>
          To get started, you'll need to use either the <a href="#share">Data
          Registry</a> online form, or download the <a href="#tools">Morpho</a>
          Desktop Application. Both of these tools will walk you through the
          process of creating a metadata document that describes your data.
        </p>
        <p>
          To prepare for using either of the above tools, it's good to have
          your files in order. You might want to take a look at some <a
          href="http://www.dataone.org/best-practices">best practices</a> for
          <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9623-90.2.205">managing your
          data files</a>. For a given project, perhaps you have 6 data files,
          and one document that describes the methods that you used to collect
          or analyze your data. Collect these files into a single directory,
          and name them with short but desciptive names. Try to avoid spaces in
          your file names, but rather use dashes "-" or underscores "_". While
          the KNB supports the upload of any data file format, sharing data can
          be greatly enhanced if you use ubiquitous, easy-to-read formats. For
          instance, while Microsoft Excel files are commonplace, it's better to
          export these spreadsheets to Comma Separated Values (CSV) text files,
          which can be read on any computer without having Microsoft products
          installed.
        </p>
        <p>
          For image files, use common formats like PNG, JPEG, TIFF, etc. Most
          all browsers can handle these. If you use specialized software to
          create your data, try to save you data in well-known formats. For
          instance, GIS data can be exported to ESRI shapefiles, and data
          created in Matlab or other matrix-based programs can be exported as
          <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/">NetCDF</a> (an
          open binary format).
        </p>
        <p>
          With your data and protocol files collected, you're ready to use the
          KNB software tools above to create metadata files in the Ecological
          Metadata Language (EML). If your project involves large numbers of
          files (hundreds to thousands), you may want to automate the creation
          of your metadata. This is certainly possible, and has been done in
          programs like Matlab, R, etc. Send a note to <a
          href="mailto:knb-help@nceas.ucsb.edu">KNB Help</a>, and we can point
          you to some examples of scripted metadata creation.

          Understanding metadata
        </h3>
        <p>
          Metadata are ultimately "data about data" - the
          contextual information needed to interpret a set of raw data
          observations. They provide meaning to data, and are critical when it
          comes to sharing, integrating, and analyzing data. Too often people
          collect data for projects and leave them undocumented for years or
          decades. These data, while potential of very high value, can become 
          useless over time due to data entropy.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a number of resources available that help in understanding
          metadata. A notable reference book is "Ecological Data: Design,
          Management and Processing", edited by William Michner and James Brunt
          <a href="http://books.google.com/books?isbn=1444311395">(ISBN
          1-444-31139-5)</a>. This book has an excellent section on metadata,
          and the idea of data entropy over the course of a scientist's career.
          Likewise, researchers at the National Center for Ecological Analysis
          and Synthesis <a href="http://nceas.ucsb.edu">(NCEAS)</a> wrote an <a
          href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9623(2005)86[158:MTVOED]2.0.CO;2"
          >excellent primer</a> on understanding and using EML, entitled
          "Maximizing the value of ecological data with structured metadata: an
          introduction to Ecological Metadata Language (EML) and principles for
          metadata creation".
        </p>
        <p>
          The two resources above should help in understanding metadata, and
          making the generation of high quality metadata a part of your
          scientific workflow. For more information, contact <a
          href="mailto:knb-help@nceas.ucsb.edu">KNB Help</a>, and we can
          further help you or your lab in effectively managing data and
          metadata.
