          About the IoE Data Gateway
        </h2>
        <p class="lead">
          The Institute on Ecosystems (IoE) Data Gateway is an Montana University System
          data repository and discovery system designed to facilitate ecological and environmental
          research.
        </p>
        <img class="pull-right" style="height: 150px;width: 150px; margin: 10px 40px 10px 20px" alt="Data underlies metadata" src="./js/themes/ioe/img/data-metadata-graphic.png">
        <p>
          For scientists, the IoE Data Gateway is an efficient way to discover, access and
          interpret complex ecological data. Thanks to rich contextual
          information, scientists are able to integrate and analyze discovered data with
          less effort. The data originate from a highly-distributed set of
          field stations, laboratories, research sites, and individual
          researchers. The foundation of the IoE Data Gateway is rich, detailed metadata
          provided by the researchers that collect data, which promotes both
          automated and manual integration of data into new projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The IoE Data Gateway is powered by the open-source Metacat data management system.
          It is optimized for handling data sets described using the Ecological 
          Metadata Language, but can store any XML-based document.

          Using the IoE Data Gateway
        </h2>
          <p>
            As a long-term data archive, the IoE Data Gateway allows you to preserve your data
            for future generations of scientists. However, you can also share
            data with your colleagues today, and get a permanent
            identifier for all files in your data set. The Gateway's data repository supports <a
            href="http://www.doi.org/">Digital Object Identifiers</a> (DOIs),
            so your data sets can be confidently referenced in any publication.
            And as a <a href="http://dataone.org">DataONE</a> Member Node, the
            IoE Data Gateway will securely replicate you data to other servers, maintaining
            all of the access controls you define. This means
            that your data are secure in the unlikely event that the IoE Data Gateway server
            experiences any catastrophic failure.

          Getting Started

          Sharing your data
        </h3>
        <p>
          To get started, you'll need to use either the <a href="#share">Data
          Registry</a> online form, or download the <a href="#tools">Morpho</a>
          Desktop Application. Both of these tools will walk you through the
          process of creating a metadata document that describes your data.
        </p>
        <p>
          To prepare for using either of the above tools, it's good to have
          your files in order. You might want to take a look at some <a
          href="http://www.dataone.org/best-practices">best practices</a> for
          <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9623-90.2.205">managing your
          data files</a>. For a given project, perhaps you have 6 data files,
          and one document that describes the methods that you used to collect
          or analyze your data. Collect these files into a single directory,
          and name them with short but desciptive names. Try to avoid spaces in
          your file names, but rather use dashes "-" or underscores "_". While
          the IoE Data Gateway supports the upload of any data file format, sharing data can
          be greatly enhanced if you use ubiquitous, easy-to-read formats. For
          instance, while Microsoft Excel files are commonplace, it's better to
          export these spreadsheets to Comma Separated Values (CSV) text files,
          which can be read on any computer without having Microsoft products
          installed.
        </p>
        <p>
          For image files, use common formats like PNG, JPEG, TIFF, etc. Most
          all browsers can handle these. If you use specialized software to
          create your data, try to save you data in well-known formats. For
          instance, GIS data can be exported to ESRI shapefiles, and data
          created in Matlab or other matrix-based programs can be exported as
          <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/">NetCDF</a> (an
          open binary format).
        </p>
        <p>
          With your data and protocol files collected, you're ready to use the
          software tools above to create metadata files in the Ecological
          Metadata Language (EML). If your project involves large numbers of
          files (hundreds to thousands), you may want to automate the creation
          of your metadata. This is certainly possible, and has been done in
          programs like Matlab, R, etc. Send a note to <a
          href="mailto:metacat-dev@ecoinformatics.org">Metacat developers</a>, and we can point
          you to some examples of scripted metadata creation.

          Understanding metadata
        </h3>
        <p>
          Metadata are ultimately "data about data" - the
          contextual information needed to interpret a set of raw data
          observations. They provide meaning to data, and are critical when it
          comes to sharing, integrating, and analyzing data. Too often people
          collect data for projects and leave them undocumented for years or
          decades. These data, while potential of very high value, can become 
          useless over time due to data entropy.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a number of resources available that help in understanding
          metadata. A notable reference book is "Ecological Data: Design,
          Management and Processing", edited by William Michner and James Brunt
          <a href="http://books.google.com/books?isbn=1444311395">(ISBN
          1-444-31139-5)</a>. This book has an excellent section on metadata,
          and the idea of data entropy over the course of a scientist's career.
          Likewise, researchers at the National Center for Ecological Analysis
          and Synthesis <a href="http://nceas.ucsb.edu">(NCEAS)</a> wrote an <a
          href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9623(2005)86[158:MTVOED]2.0.CO;2"
          >excellent primer</a> on understanding and using EML, entitled
          "Maximizing the value of ecological data with structured metadata: an
          introduction to Ecological Metadata Language (EML) and principles for
          metadata creation".
        </p>
        <p>
          The two resources above should help in understanding metadata, and
          making the generation of high quality metadata a part of your
          scientific workflow. For more information, contact the <a
          href="mailto:metacat-dev@ecoinformatics.org">Metacat system developers</a>
          or <a href="mailto:help@data.rcg.montana.edu">IoE staff </a>
          and we can further help you or your lab in effectively managing data and metadata.

          Publishing data with a DOI
        </h3>
        <p>
          Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) provide a long-term
          identifier for a data package that can be used to cite usage
          of the data and to provide a stable mechanism to find the
          current location(s) for the data.  Because the KNB creates
          replica copies of data packages via <a
          href="http://dataone.org">DataONE</a>, it is important that
          the identifier for the data set not be tied to a specific
          address on the internet, which can change over time.  DOIs
          allow an identifier to be created that can be resolved to the
          multiple locations that a data set might exist, and then
          client tools can decide which of those copies is the most
          efficient to access.
        </p>
        <p>
          To assign a DOI using the KNB requires that you have the
          proper permissions on the data set.  Simply log in to the KNB
          web interface with your username and password, and then search
          for your data package.  If you are the owner or have been
          granted management permissions, you will see a 'Publish'
          button, which both makes the data package publicly accessible
          and assigns a DOI to that particular version of the data
          package.  The DOI is registered with <a
          href="http://www.datacite.org">DataCite</a> using the <a
          href="http://ezid.cdlib.org/">EZID</a> service, and will be
          discoverable through multiple data citation networks,
          including <a href="http://dataone.org">DataONE</a> and others.

          The IoE Data Gateway supports the DataONE REST API to provide a
          common web service interface for users and developers to access
          and contribute data and metadata. This allows any software
          tool that supports the <a href="http://mule1.dataone.org/ArchitectureDocs-current/apis/">
          DataONE API</a> (such as the ONE<i>R</i> <a href="http://releases.dataone.org/online/dataone_r/">DataONE
          R client</a>) to enable seamless interaction with IoE Data Gateway objects.
          DataONE maintains the full technical documentation on the <a href=" ">
          API</a>. All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed via the
          <code>https://data.rcg.montana.edu/metacat/d1/mn/v1/</code> endpoint. The relative path
          prefix <code>mn/v1/</code> indicates that we are currently using version 1 of the DataONE
          API for Member Nodes.
